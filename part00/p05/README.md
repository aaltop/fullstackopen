# Problem 0.5: Single page app diagram

Create a diagram depicting the situation where the user goes to the 
single-page app version of the notes app at 
https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa.

## Answer

The diagram is in the file `diagram.md`. Looks like the steps are the
same as for the original example except for the location on server
being different and having a Javascript file `spa.js` instead of
`main.js`, so the diagram is merely a slight modification of the 
example diagram.
